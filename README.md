My solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) 2023.

I challenged myself to only use the Rust Standard Library.

To run a task for a given day:
```
cargo run <day>-<task>
```

## Lessons Learned
Here are some lessons I learned:

## Day 5-2
I tried to rush Day 5-2 in the morning before starting work. This led me to write poorly structured code that was ultimately very hard to debug. The task ended up taking me way longer than it should have done as a result.

I decided to spend more effort on structuring my code well as well as (some) test coverage for the future days.
